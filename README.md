#Halo2 Aggregation circuit for N Groth16 proofs

To run the tests

```
cargo test --release -- --nocapture
```

Currently its taking 364.5s for aggregating two groth16 proofs. This time if for running the code in my M1 Macbook Pro(8 Gb RAM). 

You will get the following output when you run the tests.
